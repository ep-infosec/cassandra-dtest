This is a set of cassandra-dtest exclude configuration files for use with nose-test-select
- https://github.com/EnigmaCurry/nose-test-select

(This is also a TODO list of dtests that need TLC.. patches welcome :) )

The files are for each C* branch and are run with:

  nosetests --test-select-config=conf/${C_BRANCH}_test-select.cfg
